Key Milestones in the Evolution of Software Engineering

1. The Birth of Software Engineering (1968)

The term "software engineering" was first introduced at the 1968 NATO Software Engineering Conference in response to the "Software Crisis."
Early software development was chaotic, with frequent cost overruns, missed deadlines, and unreliable software. The conference highlighted the need for systematic engineering practices to improve software quality and reliability.
This milestone led to the adoption of structured programming, modular design, and formal development methodologies.

2. The Rise of Object-Oriented Programming (1970s - 1980s)
The introduction of object-oriented programming (OOP) revolutionized software development by promoting modularity and code reusability.
Languages like Smalltalk (1972) and later C++ (1985) helped developers structure programs into reusable objects, improving maintainability and scalability.
OOP became the foundation for modern software development, influencing languages such as Java, Python, and C#.

3. The Emergence of Agile Methodologies (2001 - Present)
Traditional Waterfall models were rigid and struggled to adapt to changing requirements. In response, the Agile Manifesto was introduced in 2001, promoting flexibility, iterative development, and customer collaboration.
Agile methodologies such as Scrum, Kanban, and Extreme Programming (XP) improved software development efficiency by enabling teams to deliver incremental updates and respond to feedback quickly.
Agile has become the dominant approach in modern software engineering, especially in fast-paced industries like web development and mobile app development.


List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.

Phases of the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) 

The Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) is a structured process that ensures high-quality software is developed efficiently. It consists of several key phases:  

1. Planning  
   - Defines project goals, scope, budget, and timeline.  
   - Identifies potential risks and resource requirements.  
   - Ensures feasibility before development begins.  

2. Requirement Analysis 
   - Gathers and documents functional and non-functional requirements from stakeholders.  
   - Defines system behavior, security needs, and performance expectations.  
   - Creates a **Software Requirement Specification (SRS)** document.  

3. Design 
   - Architects the software structure, including system design, database design, and user interface (UI) design.  
   - Defines technology stacks, frameworks, and system components.  
   - Produces design documents, such as **UML diagrams** and wireframes.  

4. Implementation (Coding)  
   - Developers write code based on design specifications.  
   - Programming languages, frameworks, and tools are chosen based on project needs.  
   - Code is version-controlled, and unit testing is often performed.  

5. Testing 
   - Identifies and fixes bugs, ensuring the software meets quality standards.  
   - Includes unit testing, integration testing, system testing, and user acceptance testing (UAT).  
   - Automated and manual testing methods may be used.  

6. Deployment 
   - Releases the software to production or staging environments.  
   - Can be done in phases (e.g., beta release) or as a full deployment.  
   - Monitors system performance and resolves any post-deployment issues.  

7. Maintenance and Support  
   - Provides updates, bug fixes, and improvements based on user feedback.  
   - Ensures security patches and scalability enhancements are implemented.  
   - Involves continuous monitoring to ensure long-term performance.
